# React Drum Machine

### https://brosell1.github.io/drum-machine-reupload/

* A drum machine made using React. Click on a button to trigger a note, then click 'start' to listen to your track!

* Each row is a different note, and each column is a beat.

* The buttons change color depending on how many times they've been clicked. Different colors do different things when played!

* A green button means a single note, a blue button means a double note, and a red button means a syncopated note.
